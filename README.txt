BACKGROUND:
Hello,
Im completly new to programming and have desided to try to learn python.

After reading a few tutorials and guides wanted to see if i could make a game and this is it.
So i know that the code is really bad in many ways. 
But hopefully i will be looking back at this code in the future and see lots of improvements.

I will remake this game soon with somewhat more knowlage.

GAME:
Follow the(poorly) in written instructions in the game and place all the philosophers on the timeline accourind to each other.
The more philophers the harder it becomes.

FLAWS AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
To place philosopers by just one key input instead of y/n on everyone.
cleaner code
more inbedded notes
use only english
add tons of more philophers
make use of "replays" from the philophers


Thanks // Eric
